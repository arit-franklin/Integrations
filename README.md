# LogicMonitor Integrations

[LogicMonitor version 118 announced the ability to import/ export custom HTTP integrations!](https://www.logicmonitor.com/release-notes/v-118-release-notes/)

So, I've taken some of our [available documentation](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/settings/integrations/) and made a best effort to provide importable files that reduce the effort required to get up and running.

These are only a starting point; APIs change and update all the time, you may want to add/change/tweak these, so treat them like building blocks and don't hesitate to [reach out to LogicMonitor support](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/getting-started/advanced-logicmonitor-setup/get-support-resources/)!
